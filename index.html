            <h3>Become A Developer</h3>
            <p>In your field, much more than in others, there is this tyranny of passion. It’s so strong that it freaks
                newcomers out. In fact, we all concerned about it. Your profession is one of the few where passion is
                used as a measure to hire or determine someone’s worth. And everyone finds it normal.If you don’t work
                every night on a side project, you’re not a real dev. It’s a shameful attitude not coding outside of
                work. As a result, you don’t tell anyone that dev is not the only thing in your life. It’s your little
                secret.

                <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single
                    topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized
                    into
                    paragraphs.</p>
